Spindle is a discord bot used to manage channels. It allows you to link text channels and voice channels, so users can only view a text channel when they are in the linked voice channel.

If you dont want to give spindle Manage Channels for your entire server you can give it Manage Permissions for each text channel you link.

You can add the bot to your server using: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=768705571481452545&scope=bot&permissions=19472 and join the development server at: https://discord.gg/wKVhCXs

Planned features: The ability to create temporary channels, and an api to allow other bots to automatically create and remove channels.
