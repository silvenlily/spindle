Spindle is a discord bot used to manage channels. It allows you to link text channels and voice channels, so users can only view a text channel when they are in the linked voice channel.

If you dont want to give spindle Admin for your entire server you can give it Manage Permissions for each text channel you link.

You can add the bot to your server using: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=768705571481452545&scope=bot&permissions=19472 and join the development server at: https://discord.gg/wKVhCXs

Planned features: The ability to create temporary channels, and an api to allow other bots to automatically create and remove channels.

dependencies: Eris (https://www.npmjs.com/package/eris) and pg (https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)

If you do want to host your own instance of the bot hop in the discord server, I know the documentation is terrible im just lazy and dont wanna write documentation. (feel free to make a pull fixing this)  
If you need a vps to host your own instance of the bot you can use this affilate link to help pay for the offical instance of spindle: https://www.bisecthosting.com/clients/aff.php?aff=2506  
You can easily host an instance with the smallest vps plan ($4 a month). They are who I host the offical instance with. I have hosted with them for years and have nothing but good things to say.
